sentence=Library for controlling a 5x5x5 LED cube using shift registers
paragraph=Cubong simplifies the control of a 5x5x5 LED cube (125 LEDs) using the Arduino platform. The library uses shift registers (SN74HC595N) for multiplexing the LED matrix, providing simple functions for controlling individual LEDs, layers, creating animations, and displaying text patterns. Includes support for 3D tensor representation and the Box class for creating animated objects.
